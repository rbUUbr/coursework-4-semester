### About ###

 This is my application for generating queues for labs in BSUIR, using BSUIR's API. 
 
### Installation ###
1. Install Ruby, RVM, Rails, npm, bower
2. Go to directory
3. Run ```bundle install``` (it's can ask you for root privileges)
4. Run ```rake db:create ```
5. Run ```rake db:migrate ```
6. Run ```rake db:seed ``` - this is important step for parse schedules for all groups in BSUIR
7. Run ``` rails server(or rails s) ```

### TODO List ###
1. Make queues for all groups
2. Make registration on site
3. Make registration for queues
4. Enable SideKiq
